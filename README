This is a Siriserver remake of Eichhoernchen�s siriserver, but for Windows


THIS ISN' T WOKING YET IT HAS A BUG WITH LIBSPEEX
If anybody knows how to make the speex.py work with the libspeex.dll please send me a message!


It includes:
An NL version of the plugins, it has replaced the DE version, to activate it turn on DE in your idevice�s siri settings
All Windows install instructions.
And much plugin�s!!

Setup:
Open the install dir and install 1, 2, 3
Open cmd and goto the folder where you have easy_install (most times it is in your python\scripts directory)
Run easy_install 'Path to 4.egg'
Run: easy_install bplist
Goto the scripts dir and open the dns.py file in editor mode, replace the ip goes here with your ip (it�s on line 5)
Run the Startsiriserver.bat file and you�re done on the pc

On your iDevice install spire from cydia
When you installed goto settings>wifi>blue arrow of your wifi and set the dns to your pc�s ip (if your pc turns of you need to change it back to the ip of the router, or you cant internet anymore)
Create certs with open ssl (by common name you must insert your ip)

openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096

openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

 

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 4096

openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out server.passless.crt

openssl rsa -in server.key -out 

Move server.key server.key.secure

Move server.key.insecure server.passless.key

and copy all the generated certs to the certs folder

send the CA.crt to your iDevice and install that
in spire settings insert your ip as proxy server

ENJOY
